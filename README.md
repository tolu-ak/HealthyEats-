🌟 About the Project**
HealthyEats was developed as a resource for immigrants in Canada who face cultural food inaccessibility and are at risk of diet-related diseases such as Type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies show that 26% of immigrants in Canada have such health issues, often due to limited access to familiar and nutritious meal options.

Healthier alternatives to cultural dishes that are accessible within Canada.
Restaurant suggestions for cultural meals in your Canadian province.
